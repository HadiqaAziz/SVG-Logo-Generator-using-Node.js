# SVG-Logo-Generator-using-Node.js
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
# How it works?
A command line application will accept 4 user inputs
# 1. TEXT
User can enter upto three characters to be shown in logo
# 2.TEXT COLOR
User can enter text color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
# 3. SHAPE
User will be presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
# SHAPE COLOR 
User can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number) for shape
After getting all the user inputs a SVG file is created named `logo.svg`and the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
when user opens the `logo.svg` file in a browser,it shows a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria user entered
